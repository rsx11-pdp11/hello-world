# hello-world
initial test repository

hi there
this is the famous hello world project known through out the world created by a simple human like me. Unlike humans like you i am not ordinary as I like to be always with my non-human friends like hp, ibm, oracle, sap, gcp, aws, android, arduino, raspberry pi and soldering iron. Plus I love to play with my python, perl and php pet.
